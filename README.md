# TLS 1.3 Secure Communication App  

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a **secure Android application** that communicates with a **C-based server** using **TLS 1.3 encryption**. The application ensures a **high level of security** by enforcing **strong cryptographic protocols** and protecting against **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks, downgrade attacks, and data interception**.  

Built with **C and Android Studio**, this project focuses on **real-world secure client-server communication** while maintaining efficiency and performance.

## Features  
âœ… **End-to-End Encryption** â€“ TLS 1.3 ensures that all communications are encrypted.  
âœ… **Strong Authentication** â€“ The server verifies client identity using certificates.  
âœ… **Perfect Forward Secrecy** â€“ Prevents past communications from being decrypted if keys are compromised.  
âœ… **Android Client** â€“ Secure app for sending & receiving encrypted messages.  
âœ… **C-Based Server** â€“ Handles encrypted communication using OpenSSL/BoringSSL.

## Technology Stack  
- **Client:** Android Studio (Java/Kotlin)  
- **Server:** C (OpenSSL/BoringSSL for TLS 1.3)  
- **Protocol:** TLS 1.3 with **AES-GCM & ChaCha20** for encryption  
- **Networking:** Secure WebSockets / TCP

## Defenses & Mitigation Strategies  

### ðŸ”¹ Preventing Security Misconfigurations  
- **Enforce TLS 1.3 only** to eliminate support for older, vulnerable versions (TLS 1.2 and below).  
- **Disable weak cipher suites** and ensure only strong, modern encryption algorithms are used.  
- **Use secure certificate management**, including automatic renewal and certificate pinning.  

### ðŸ”¹ Securing Client-Server Communication  
- **Implement certificate pinning** in the Android app to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.  
- **Verify server certificates properly** to avoid accepting self-signed or untrusted certificates.  
- **Use strong authentication mechanisms**, such as OAuth2 or mutual TLS (mTLS), for client-server validation.  

### ðŸ”¹ Protecting Against Network Attacks  
- **Enforce strict hostname verification** to prevent redirection to malicious servers.  
- **Use HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** to prevent protocol downgrade attacks.  
- **Monitor and log TLS handshakes** to detect unauthorized access attempts and anomalies.
